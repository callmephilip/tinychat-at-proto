## What is this and who is this for?

Tons of collaboration and communication online happens in group chats these days. Most of these are private. Pretty much all of them hold on to people's data and make it painfully difficult to access it from outside the castle walls.

Some chats should stay private but a lot of them would benefit from being public, accessible, indexable and usable by a larger community.

_tinychat_ is an exploration of this big idea using open source tools and [protocols](https://atproto.com/).

This project is for open source developers, community builders willing to try something new.

It's in a very early stage so please be gentle and generous.

## Navigating codebase

This project uses [jurassic](https://github.com/callmephilip/jurassic) for development and exploration.
